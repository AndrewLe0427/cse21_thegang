# Github
For CSE 21 group assignemnts, we will like to use github to cooperate our work. There are some following steps help you catch up using github.

# Fork
For this repoository, I recommend everyone fork the repo as your own first because I the real world mothod for open-source project. 

First step, `Fork` this repo to your own repo on website. 

# Clone and Modify your Files
You have to clone the reop to local. you could use `clone` commnd if you have already [install](https://git-scm.com/downloads)ed `git` tools.

## Clone
Once git tool has been installed, [clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) repo to you local environment. 

For example:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/microzen/cse21_thegang.git
```

Remember change to your Fork repo. It should be https://github.com/[your github name]/cse21_thegang.git.

## Modify, Push, Pull
When your files is changed, you have to submit the change to your **local** git first.

#TODO

After a `commit` to your file, the command `push` could allow you [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) your local works to Github.

#TODO

# Pull Requires
It is the most important part to submit your works to the orignal repo. In this case, your submit your works to my repo, then I/Menagers will combine them into [Microzen]'s repo.
